/**
 * 274. H-Index
 DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
 Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
 index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
 the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
 has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations
 respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations
 each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

 Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
